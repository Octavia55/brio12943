Storage image backup

With [image backup](https://backupchain.com/i/disk-backup), the entire data carrier (usually the hard disk, but also USB mass storage devices, optical media or, with some programs, data carriers in the network) or only a partition can be backed up with a 1-to-1 image. For example, not only the user data, but the entire file system, including the operating system and user settings, can be saved. The advantage of this backup is that in the event of a total failure of the computer, the memory image can be restored to the data medium and thus the state of the respective data medium at the time of the backup can be fully restored. During such a restore, either the entire file system is restored in its original structure (in this case no file system driver is required, only a device driver for disk access), or a special driver regularly reads the file system and extracts only the desired directories and files from the backup in order to integrate them as normal directories and files into the current file system or to overwrite the current ones with the older ones that were backed up (see also "Incremental backup"). Since a few years there are also programs on the market that can create such backups incrementally as well.
Differential backup

With the so-called differential backup, all files that have been changed or newly added since the last complete backup are saved. This means that the last complete backup is always used again, saving storage space and time compared to a new full backup. If a file has been changed, the respective version of the file is backed up with each differential run.

The advantage is the significantly reduced memory requirement, and that the current backup is only one step away from the last full backup. The programming of the backup software can be relatively simple. Another advantage is that backup states that are no longer needed can be deleted independently, whereas incremental backups are necessarily chained together. However, for very large files that change frequently (virtual machines, databases, mailbox files of some e-mail programs), differential backup is disadvantageous; differential backup always backs up the entire file again, despite the smallest changes.
Incremental backup

With incremental backup, only those files or parts of files are saved that have been changed or newly added since the last incremental backup or (in the case of the first incremental backup) since the last complete backup. Thus, it is always based on the last incremental backup. The disadvantage of this procedure is that when restoring, the data usually has to be reassembled from several backups. Various techniques (date stamps, checksums) must be used to ensure that the complete chain (full backup - incremental backups 1, 2, 3, etc. - original data) can be traced without errors.

It should be noted that the increments can be stored in two ways:

Forward deltas are common. This corresponds to the case described above: the (older) full backup serves as a foundation and is not changed, while the increments are built on top of it. The current dataset can only be restored taking increments into account. 
An [incremental backup](https://backupchain.com/en/backupchain/) with reverse deltas reverses this principle. Imagine the edge of a roof with icicles growing down from it. The full backup changes with each backup and represents the edge of the roof here. The growing icicles are the increments. If a file has changed since the last full backup, the previous file version is saved as an increment - the icicle grows downwards - while the current version is inserted into the full backup. The full backup can be easily accessed at any time, while an older version of a file can be restored only by considering the increments. 

The advantage of incremental backup is the very low storage requirement; the procedure is therefore suitable for data backup in networks or in the cloud. On the other hand, due to the principle, all increments are chained together, which is why it is only possible to remove an increment between two other increments with a very large amount of computing effort, for example to save storage space or to delete private data.
