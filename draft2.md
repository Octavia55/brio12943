For this reason, precautions are taken preventively and promptly for important data in the event of data loss, data manipulation or data alteration, in order to enable data recovery with the aid of backup copies created in advance of the loss event with as up-to-date a status as possible. Another complicating factor is that errors can also occur during the creation of the backup copy, which must be detected and eliminated as quickly as possible by comparison with the original data. Appropriate security measures must be taken at different levels (byte, field, data record, file, transaction level, database, application level, at system-wide level or even in the computer network) using adequate procedures.

According to the security measures taken, the procedures for data recovery also differ.

In the event of a catastrophe, such as natural disasters, in which both the original data and its backup copy and transaction logs were partially destroyed and no precautionary backup measures had been taken, there is at best still the possibility of data recovery as an emergency measure, whereby an attempt is made to restore the most important, relevant data fragments as best as possible from a storage medium that has only been partially damaged or modified. 


Recovery may be necessary after individual, human errors (accidental deletion), but also after a defect of storage media (due to external, extreme environmental influences, mechanical fatigue, etc.), when other system errors occur or after activation of malicious programs (English: "malware"). Sometimes recovery is only possible with the help of further technical measures, but data can also be irretrievably lost.

Self-monitoring systems such as S.M.A.R.T., which is supported by all modern hard disks, can sometimes prevent imminent data loss by detecting signs of wear at an early stage. The use of an antivirus program reduces the risk of data loss due to malware. Deleted data can be recovered via a recycle bin or system recovery in many operating systems. Various [server backup solutions](https://backupchain.com/en/server-backup/) on the market, such as IsoBuster or Ontrack EasyRecovery, also promise to retrieve data that is thought to be lost and can no longer be recovered using the operating system's internal functions. However, this only works under certain circumstances and depends, for example, on whether a data segment has been overwritten. The last port of call for victims can be to consult a specialized company. In particularly serious cases, data can even be reconstructed from storage media under cleanroom conditions.

The technical basis for many recovery measures was once the fact that files were not physically deleted when they were erased or formatted on most data media, but were initially merely "hidden" or marked as "deleted". However, the data itself remained on the medium until the corresponding area was overwritten with new data. With the introduction of SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) for hard disks and the integration of technologies such as TRIM for hard disks and SSDs, data recovery with the help of data recovery software is often no longer possible. With regard to hard drive data recovery, this is especially true for newer models from Western Digital with SMR. With these hard disks, the firmware of the hard disk ensures that physical access to deleted data and thus data recovery via software is no longer possible.

Overwriting mass storage devices with the help of special programs (Eraser) or program functions of the system administration (Overwrite mass storage device with zeros) is, in addition to the physical destruction of the data carrier, the most effective measure to make the recovery of the former data impossible.Some programs optionally overwrite the file contents several times with fixed patterns or random contents before deletion, whereby with modern mass storage devices a single overwrite is sufficient to achieve effective protection.
